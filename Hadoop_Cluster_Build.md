# Hadoop Cluster

For the demo purposes we will use the HDP 2.3 Sandbox.

Download the Sandbox from [HDP 2.3](http://hortonworks.com/hdp/downloads/)
Sandbox has everything needed except for latest of Apache Atlas.
Apache Atlas needs to be built from source.

You would have to install "git" to get a clone of the Atlas repository.

          git clone https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-atlas.git atlas
          
  
#### Install Maven
          wget http://www.carfab.com/apachesoftware/maven/maven-3/3.2.5/binaries/apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.tar.gz
          tar xvf apache-maven-3.2.5-bin.tar.gz
          mv apache-maven-3.2.5 /usr/local/
          
          
          mv apache-maven-3.2.5 /usr/local/
